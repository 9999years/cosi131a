# Code for Brandeisâ€™ COSI 131A

ðŸ˜Š

## Notice for Wandering Brandeis Students: Be Wary!

I was bored and I'm bad at solving problems "the correct way", so many of these solutions are horrifyingly overcomplicated (like, one of them uses reflection) or broken entirely. I don't think I got full credit on several of them â€” although they can't be that bad because the professor did ask me to TA the next semester.

Code is provided with full knowledge that it is not fit for any purpose!
